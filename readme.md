# Algorithmic Toolbox 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments from the **Algorithmic Toolbox** course on Coursera. The course, offered by the **University of California San Diego** and **National Research University Higher School of Economics**, covers fundamental algorithmic techniques.

## 📌 Course Overview
The **Algorithmic Toolbox** explores key algorithmic strategies, including:
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**


## 🗂 Repository Structure
Each assignment is organized into modules corresponding to the course topics.


Each folder contains:
- **Problem Statements**
- **My Implementations**
- **Test Cases**

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python 
- **Algorithmic Paradigms**: Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Divide and Conquer

## 🚀 How to Run Example
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dawilliams0727/algorithmic-toolbox.git

   cd algorithmic-toolbox/week4_divide_and_conquer
   python3 inversions.py
    ```

   document the inputs and outputs required for each file
